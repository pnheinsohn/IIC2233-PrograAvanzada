## To Consider

- Run with "python .\FrontEnd.py"

- Try not dying, because "play again option is bugged"
 
- Collisions between enemies, character, bombs or any type of objects are "trigger" type, so, you can overstep them. However, the borders are different.

- Enemy sprites are not coordinated with their movement

- Sprite and real object positions are not well coordinated. The real position is in the top left corner of the sprite

- For dealing or receiving damage, player and enemies must be colliding.

- Going back to main menu and pressing to play again won't work.

- Bomb radius is 10 + sprite radius units

- Pause Game "Ctrl + P" | Open Store "Ctrl + T"
